This circuit is designed for counting visitors who are entering and leaving a room. 
It can be employed to many applications like automatic light on-off mechanisms, 
power saving mechanisms, etc. IR sensors are made use of to implement this project.
Infrared or simply IR Sensors are devices that work with Infrared Light Source and 
a Photo Detector like a Photo Diode or a Photo Transistor that act as a Transmitter 
and Receiver respectively. 
The project uses an IR LED as the IR transmitter and a photo diode as the IR receiver.
Two sets of IR sensors consisting of an IR LED and photo diode are placed at two ends 
of the entrance of a room. Output from each sensor is fed to the microcontroller. In 
normal operation, IR light from the LED would not fall on the Photo Diode as it is a 
Reflective type IR Sensor. The output from the sensor would be a logic LOW signal in 
this case.
